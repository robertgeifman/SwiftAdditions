	/// the typesetter, and others only affect the behavior of the

	/// with. If you wish to specify the default set of settings,
	/// then this parameter may be set to `nil`.
	/// - returns: If the paragraph style creation was successful, this function
	/// will return a valid reference to an immutable `CTParagraphStyle`
	/// object. Otherwise, this function will return `nil`.
	///
	/// Using this function is the easiest and most efficient way to
	/// create a paragraph style. Paragraph styles should be kept
	/// immutable for totally lock-free operation.

	/// the "settings" parameter, nothing bad will happen but just don't
	/// expect to be able to query for this value. This is to allow
	/// backwards compatibility with style setting specifiers that may
	/// be introduced in future versions.

	/// "valueBuffer" parameter. This value must be at least as large as the size the
	/// required by the `Specifier` value set in the "spec" parameter.
	/// - parameter valueBuffer: The buffer where the requested setting value will be
	/// written upon successful completion. The buffer's size needs to be at least as
	/// large as the value passed into "valueBufferSize".
	/// - returns: This function will return "true" if the `valueBuffer` had been
	/// successfully filled. Otherwise, this function will return `false`,
	/// indicating that one or more of the parameters is not valid.

	/// This function will return the current value of the specifier
	/// whether or not the user had actually set it. If the user has
	/// not set it, this function will return the default value.

	/// the "spec" parameter, nothing bad will happen and the buffer
	/// value will simply be zeroed out. This is to allow backwards
	/// compatibility with style setting specifier that may be introduced
	/// in future versions.
