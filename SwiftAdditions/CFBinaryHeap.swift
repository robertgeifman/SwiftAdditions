	/// CFAllocator is used. If this reference is not a valid
	/// CFAllocator, the behavior is undefined.
	/// - parameter capacity: A hint about the number of values that will be held
	/// by the `CFBinaryHeap`. Pass `0` for no hint. The implementation may
	/// ignore this hint, or may use it to optimize various
	/// operations. A heap's actual capacity is only limited by
	/// address space and available memory constraints).
	/// This parameter must be greater than or equal
	/// to the count of the heap which is to be copied, or the
	/// behavior is undefined. If this parameter is negative, the
	/// behavior is undefined.
	/// - returns: A reference to the new mutable binary heap.
	///
	/// The values from the binary heap are copied as pointers into the new binary heap (that is, the values
	/// themselves are copied, not that which the values point to, if anything). However, the values are also
	/// retained by the new binary heap. The count of the new binary will be the same as the given binary
	/// heap. The new binary heap uses the same callbacks as the binary heap to be copied.
